<!---* I worked by myself on this challenge

Your mission description:
 
You are in the woods at night. Find your way home safely!

Pseudocode
 
Initialize object user

Set property "living" of user to true

Ask user "You come across a path. Do you walk down it?"
IF user responds "yes"
	Tell user "You find a gun. Do you pick it up?"
		IF user responds "yes"
			set hasGun property of user to true
			Tell user "Great. Now you're ready to fight!"
			Ask user "Do you continue down the path?"
				IF user responds "yes"
					Tell user "You are attacked by a zombie! Do you fight back?"
						IF user responds "yes"
							IF hasGun=true
								Tell user "You shoot and kill the zombie! Good work!"
								Tell user "Would you like to keep walking down the path?"
								IF user responds "yes"
									Tell user "You've finally made it home! You win!"
								IF user responds with anything else
									"The path appears to be the only way out of the woods. Are you sure you don't want to go down it?"
							ELSE
								Tell user "You try to defend yourself but the zombie rips off your head and you die! If only you'd had a gun!"			
						ELSE
							"The zombie rips your head off! You're dead!"
							Set property "living" of user to false
				If user responds with anything else
						"The path appears to be the only way out of the woods. Are you sure you don't want to go down it?"
If user responds with anything else
	"The path appears to be the only way out of the woods. Are you sure you don't want to go down it?"
