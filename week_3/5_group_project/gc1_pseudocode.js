/*Test 1

Define a function called "sum" that takes an argument "arr"
	SET total to zero
	FOR each number in arr
		ADD the current element to total
	END
	PRINT total
END

Test 2

Define a function called "mean" that takes an argument "arr"
	CALL sum function
	SET answer to total / number of arguments in "arr"
	PRINT answer
END

Test 3

Define a function called "median" that takes an argument "arr"
	Sort the elements in arr
	IF the length of arr is odd
		SET answer to the element in arr at the index, rounded down, of (length of array / 2)
	ELSE IF the length of arr is even
		SET the answer to the average of the elements in arr at the index of (length of array/2) and ([length of array/2]-1)
	END
	PRINT answer
END
