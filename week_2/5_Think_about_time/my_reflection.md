# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

I am not currently working, so I don't feel that I am going to have too much trouble with the Phase 0 work from a time management perspective. That said, I am still trying to maximize my use of the time I currently have available to myself, and maintaining focus and staying productive can be challenging.

* How will you combat that? 

I find that I am able to maintain focus on work more easily when the other parts of my life are stable. Among other things, this means getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, minimizing alcohol consumption.

* What techniques will you try?

I have found meditation helpful in the past although I have not done it with any real regularity in the past. For me, doing this in the morning after a good night's sleep is very helpful.

* Whatis your overall plan for Phase 0?

-Read through all the assigned material for each week at or prior to the beginning of the week.
-Assess how long I expect each of the exercises to take
-Work through them as quickly as possible
-Also study additional material that seems useful as I discover it, and ideally work on and complete side projects.
