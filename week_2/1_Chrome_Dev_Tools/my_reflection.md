# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?


The Document Object Model (or DOM) is an organization model for documents that places the content into various objects, and then organizes them logically in a tree-like structure. For example, within an HTML document, there might exist both <HEAD> and <BODY> objects. Each of these elements could be considered a "branch" off of the HTML root element. Other elements might then branch off from these elements, such as headers and paragraphs branching off from the body element.

One advantage of the DOM is that it allows us to place objects into categories and then manipulate them as we see fit. For example, we can choose to use to CSS to change the appearance of every paragraph within a document.



* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?

The wordpress site was a lot more complex and used JavaScript, while my site currently does not.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?

The ability to make modifications and see their impact immediately without having to edit a file and reload it in the browser is great.

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?

Not one particular moment, but I feel that the more time I spend using the time the more comfortable I become with it and the more useful it becomes.

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
