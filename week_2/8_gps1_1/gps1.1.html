            <h2>Pair Programming</h2>
            <p>People often think of programmers as working primarily alone, but
            recently developers have taken to working in pairs. This "pair programming"
            approach allows developers to learn from each other and 
            work more efficiently.</p>
            <p>To pair program effectively, it is important that both participants 
            communicate with one another and have clearly defined roles.</p>
            <p>Typically, these roles are the "driver" and the "navigator".</p>
            <h3>Driver</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Uses the keyboard</li>
                    <li>Takes direction from the navigator</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Navigator</h3>

                <ul>
                    <li>Tells the driver what to write</li>
                    <li>Directs the overall though process in the exercise</li>
                </ul>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>Building this page together was a good introduction to the pair programming experience. 
            We struggled a bit initially with the CSS, but were able to achieve a result we were happy with
            through effective communication.</p>
